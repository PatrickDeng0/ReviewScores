# ReviewScores
Sentimental Analysis of Reviews in Amazon, Data Analytics @ Columbia

We worked on the Amazon fine food dataset, and used reviews to predict the scores of them. After solving imbalance in dataset and text preprocessing, we constructed machine learning models to do sentiment analysis. The models we utilized includes MNB, Logistic Regression, Ordinal Regression, and LSTM. The performance metrics include classification accuracy and MSE. After comparison, we found that the performance of our models are improved from the Vader baseline, and LSTM model achieved the best accuracy and lowest MSE according to the boxplots we created. Finally, we notice the ability of our model to distinguish the discrepancies in reviews and scores.
